## GEMki

GEMki is a *Note Style* for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the digital spaced-repetition flashcard software. The note style was originally developed for use by the  graduate-entry medical students at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland '25. The note style can be thought of as a cross between the note style of [Anking's premade USMLE deck](https://www.ankipalace.com/step-1-deck) as well as MarlinAnatomy's deck, with some of our own influence too. Some added features of GEMki include:

- Fade in animations, which makes transitioning between cards less jarring
- A colour scheme which automatically colours text as **bold**, _italic_ or underlined
	- Colours are based off of those seen in [Dracula UI](https://draculatheme.com/ui)
- Info about the card being reviewed in the bottom left (requires the [Additional Fields](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/744725736) addon)
- Countdown until the next exam, as well as details about that exam (manually added)
- Logo mark to distinguish the source of different cards in a collaborative deck
- Menlo font as default on MacOS, and Source Sans Pro on Windows
- Better styled tags at the bottom of the screen ([clickable tags](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1739176371) functionality supported)
- Support for the "[Edit Field During Review (Cloze)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/385888438)" addon, so that ctrl+clicking the text during reviewing allows the user to edit the card, even after it has been flipped
